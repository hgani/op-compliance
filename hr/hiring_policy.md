## Diversity and Inclusion

### Our Hiring Philosophy

- **Global team**: Geographic location is not a barrier to joining our team

### Our Culture
- **Collaborative environment**: Knowledge sharing and mutual support

## Red Flags

- **Salary-focused**: Only interested in compensation, not the work (passion) or growth
- **Fixed mindset**: Unwilling to learn new technologies or adapt
- **Short-term outlook**: Seeking stepping stone position rather than long-term career
- **Corporate preference**: Wants environment that small company cannot provide:
  - Structured, hierarchical organization
  - Formal career progression and promotion tracks
  - Large teams with specialized roles only
- **Poor communication**: Slow responses or unprofessional attitude during hiring process
