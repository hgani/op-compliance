
* Be very clear about what a policy should/can contain:
  - Internal policies may contain sensitive details like:
    - Chosen technology stack
    - Checklists and procedures
    - Internal processes (who does what, when)
    - Development and readiness status
  - Public (client-facing) summaries focus on:
    - What we do (not how we do it)
    - High-level security posture
    - Compliance status and commitments
    - No internal tools/procedures
