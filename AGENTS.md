
* All documentation should be written with these considerations in mind:
  - The company is a small company
    - Consisting of one director and few employees/contractors
    - Our operation is lean and efficient
    - Our work culture prioritises pragmatism and effectiveness
    - Our team is distributed, some personnel are located overseas
  - Make sure policies are realistic for its size
    - Not overly complex
    - Not too bureaucratic and litigious
  - It is for human consumption
    - It needs to be concise, minimize repetition
    - It needs to provide specifics and examples
      - Being a tech company, our documentation needs to be specific on technical guidelines.
  - Don't include information that will go out of date very quickly

* Be very clear about what a policy should/can contain:
  - Internal policies may contain sensitive details like:
    - Chosen technology stack
    - Checklists and procedures
    - Internal processes (who does what, when)
    - Development and readiness status
  - Public (client-facing) summaries focus on:
    - What we do (not how we do it)
    - High-level security posture
    - Compliance status and commitments
    - No internal tools/procedures
