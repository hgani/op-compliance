
* All documentation should be written with these considerations in mind:
  - The company is a small company
    - Consisting of one director and few employees/contractors
    - Our operation is lean and efficient
    - Our work culture prioritises pragmatism and effectiveness
    - Our team is distributed, some personnel are located overseas
  - Make sure policies are realistic for the company size
    - Not overly complex
    - Not too bureaucratic and litigious
  - It is for human consumption
    - Every single point needs to be actionable
    - It needs to be concise, minimize repetition
    - It needs to provide specifics and examples
      - Being a tech company, our documentation needs to be specific on technical guidelines.
  - Don't include information that will go out of date very quickly
